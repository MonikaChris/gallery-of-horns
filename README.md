Note: Got stuck on "this" binding - first used an arrow function, click resulted in NAN output. I tried to use a regular
function declaration instead (since these don't have "this" binding issues of arrow functions) but then the output wouldn't change at all, couldn't even print a value I passed in to set state (not sure why this function declaration didn't work).
Switched back to arrow functions and tried a few different ways to bind "this" and finally found a way to get the right 
behavior, but not sure if this is the optimal solution.

Actual time: 50 minutes
